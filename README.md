üõ†Ô∏è Development Notes





Custom Template Tags: The multiply filter (shop/templatetags/shop_tags.py) calculates cart item totals.



2FA: Console-based OTP for development; configure Twilio for production.



Emails: Console-based in development (EMAIL_BACKEND = 'django.core.mail.backends.console.EmailBackend'); configure SMTP for production.



Stock Management: Products are removed when stock reaches zero; no restocking on returns.



Celery: Removed due to Windows compatibility issues; synchronous tasks used for emails.

üêõ Troubleshooting





Template Errors: Ensure shop/templatetags/shop_tags.py and __init__.py exist, and restart the server.



Form Validation: Check terminal for form errors if checkout fails.



Database Issues: Run python manage.py makemigrations and migrate after model changes.



Logs: Check terminal or DEBUG=True logs for errors.

For issues, check the Django admin or share error tracebacks.
